# AI self-play gate + report. Runs headless AI-vs-AI across every combat
# scenario at several difficulty pairings and asserts each battle:
#   * terminates within the turn cap (no infinite loop / stall),
#   * ends with a valid winner faction id or "" (draw),
#   * leaves every living unit on a unique hex, drawn exactly on its coord
#     (stress test for the occupancy + move-sync invariants under full AI play).
# It also prints a win/margin line per battle so the same run doubles as a
# balance/AI-strength report. NOTE: on the historical scenarios outcomes are
# dominated by scenario/side balance, so this gate does NOT assert an ordering
# there. It DOES assert monotonicity on the near-symmetric sandbox mirror (both
# side assignments), where side balance cancels out: with the objective /
# lookahead / coordination AI, a stronger difficulty must out-survive a weaker
# one there. (Before that work the ladder was non-monotonic — hard overextended
# and lost to easy even on the symmetric map.)
