# Deterministic combat resolution.
# Damage scales with the attacker's current HP — a bloodied formation hits softer.
# The defender counter-attacks if it survives, the attacker is in its reach, and
# it can retaliate (melee/short reach; guns can trade fire, but indirect pieces
# and no_counter crews cannot counter). Counter damage is halved.
#
# `armor` models heavy plate / barding (knights, gendarmes, cuirassiers) and
# `vs_armor` the bonus of pikes, halberds and cannon that punch through it.
#
# Pure logic, no scene side effects — caller applies the result.
